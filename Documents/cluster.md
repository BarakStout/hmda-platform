# HMDA Akka Cluster Configuration

## Cluster Management

The project uses the [Akka Cluster HTTP Management](http://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-management/current/cluster-http-management.html) module to report on cluster member status as well as to perform cluster
management tasks. Please refer to the documentation of this module for cluster management tasks (i.e. downing a node from the cluster)
