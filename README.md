## The HMDA Platform

This repository contains the code for the entirety of the `HMDA Platform` backend. This platform has been designed to accommodate the needs of the HMDA filing process by financial institutions, as well as the data management and publication needs of the HMDA data asset.
The code contained in this repository covers two distinct versions of the HMDA backend, referred to as `v1` (2017 data collection) and `v2` (2018 and later data collection).

The documentation for each version is linked below:

* [HMDA Platform V1 Documentation](docs/v1/README.md)

* [HMDA Platform V2 Documentation](docs/v2/README.md)

The main `GitHub` branch, `master`, points to the latest version of the HMDA Platform.
